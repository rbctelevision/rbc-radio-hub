Place the social preview image here with the filename `og-image.png`.

This image is referenced by the site's Open Graph and Twitter meta tags so it appears when sharing the site link on social platforms.

Recommended sizes:
- 1200 x 630 pixels (best for most social platforms)
- Use PNG or JPG (filename: `og-image.png`)

Steps:
1. Save the image you attached in the project root or download it to your machine.
2. Place the image at `public/og-image.png`.
3. Deploy or serve the site. Sharing the site URL should now show the image preview.

If you want me to add the image file directly, upload it to the repository or provide a public URL I can fetch from.
